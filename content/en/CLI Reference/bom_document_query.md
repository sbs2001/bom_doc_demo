## bom document query

bom document query → Search for information in an SBOM

### Synopsis

bom document query → Search for information in an SBOM

The query subcommand creates a way to extract information
from an SBOM. It exposes a simple search language to filter
elements in the sbom that match a certain criteria.

The query interface allows the number of filters to grow
over time. The following filters are available:

  depth:N       The depth filter will match elements
                reachable at N levels from the document root.

  name:pattern  Matches all elements in the document that
                contain <pattern> in their name.

Example:

  # Match all second level elements with log4j in their name:
  bom document query sbom.spdx "depth:2 name:log4j"



```
bom document query SPDX_FILE "query expression"  [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for query
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --log-level string   the logging verbosity, either 'panic', 'fatal', 'error', 'warning', 'info', 'debug', 'trace' (default "info")
```
