## Installation

### Using binary:

You can see releases of `bom` on [Github Releases](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/bom/releases/). 

Replace the tag,os and architecture as required for below commands to install.

```console
curl -L  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/bom/releases/download/v0.2.2/bom-linux-amd64  -o bom
sudo mv ./bom /usr/local/bin/bom
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bom
```

### Using go:

```console
go install sigs.k8s.io/bom/cmd/bom
```


## Examples

The following examples show how bom can process different sources to generate
an SPDX Bill of Materials. Multiple sources can be combined to get a document
describing different packages.

### Generate a SBOM from the Current Directory

To process a directory as a source for your SBOM, use the `-d` flag or simply pass
the path as the first argument to `bom`:

```bash
bom generate -n http://example.com/ .
```

### Process a Container Image

This example pulls the `kube-apiserver` image, analyzes it, and describes in the
SBOM. Each of its layers are then expressed as a subpackage in the resulting
document:

```console
bom generate -n http://example.com/ --image registry.k8s.io/kube-apiserver:v1.21.0
```

### Generate a SBOM to describe files

You can create an SBOM with just files in the manifest. For that, use `-f`:

```console
bom generate -n http://example.com/ \
  -f Makefile \
  -f file1.exe \
  -f document.md \
  -f other/file.txt
```
